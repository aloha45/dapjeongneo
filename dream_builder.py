# dreams are divs that get clicked on to be put in a bin
# to do that, they will have an on-off switch?

# Dream_board = ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']
# then map the dream board to divs in html that have the symbols on them
# when clicking on the symbol, that index of the dream_board gets updated
# and on the page the symbol changes color
# how to change what goes in the dream_board[idx] so each symbol has a unique entry?
# dream_board[idx] = '{idx}' ??

# what about a handle function on the onClick that does all of this? changes the color, updates the db idx,
# maybe save too?

# when page is loaded, the dream_board is reset 
# we probably need a dream_board model: 
# dream_board with 12 boolean rows
# dream_board gets saved when submitted
# one user has many dbs

# dream_point = input('choose 1 - 12: ')
