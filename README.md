"The answer is already set in stone; all you have to do is give me that answer."

Dapjeongneo is a Korean word refering to the feeling when someone asks a question and they already know the answer, but they are waiting for the expected answer. Part dream journal, part horoscope, part code, Dapjeongneo takes in what you give it and tells you what comes next.
